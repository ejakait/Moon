In this post we will be covering Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA) of a Kaggle data set,[ House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques.](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques)

If you want to do this on your own as well, you might need a couple of things,

1. Python3.6
2. Pip
3. Jupyter Notebook 

Or, 

If you prefer less setup, I would suggest you take a look at Microsoft Azure Notebooks. It has most of what we will be using already installed and it runs Jupyter Lab.

So what is Exploratory Data Analysis anyway and what is its purpose?

The simple answer is that EDA is the first impressions you get from the data. The reasons however are more in number

1. detection of mistakes 
2. checking of assumptions 
3. preliminary selection of appropriate models 
4. determining relationships among the explanatory variables, and 
5. assessing the direction and rough size of relationships between explanatory and outcome variables.
