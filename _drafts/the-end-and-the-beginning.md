I have been lazy and reluctant to create this blog let a lone write on  it, more so because I never have anything to talk about except League of Legends and how unemployed I am(the two have nothing to do with each other). Some context on my situation, I am recent graduate in the field of Informatics, little of which I learned  about or was taught, so pretty much like every other Kenyan university I would assume.

However, when I decided to take the path towards becoming a data scientist I knew I had to overcome a lot of my flaws, one of which is communication.I would need develop a lot of what I will say now are painful habits but are important in creating and fostering the right mindset toward a relatively new and challenging field.

My journey starts with a Data Camp course(ongoing), knowing next to nothing aside from some competence in Python. I was excited and still am because of the how much I will and am learning along the way, about data science and more importantly about myself. I believe that the most important part of this process figuring out what data science IS and what it is not.
