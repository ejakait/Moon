  aside from technical competencies in programming, statistics and machine learning
  models is communication. '

There is no better way to communicate your thoughts to large audience than through a blog post, at least none that I can afford. So the primary aim of my posts will be to share as much as I can about how I understand data science and its specializations.

For my first trick I will attempt to conjure an understanding of all things data science with help of a large snake, a panda, a science kit and many more. I will be covering topical content from the Data Science from Scratch along with a host of other resources and some cool stuff I learn from doing [Kaggle](http://kaggle.com) competitions(The Knowledge and Playground competitions). 

My next post will cover the [House Prices](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques) where we will attempt to  predict the price of a house based on its features. It is geared towards practicing feature engineering which involves finding the right attributes to use in our prediction model(regression models).

###### _Just and FYI, I have no formal training as a data scientist and little experience in the field, these posts reflect a journey towards obtaining both those things._
