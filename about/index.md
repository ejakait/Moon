My name is Caleb Ejakait and I am currently a Software Engineer and Data Engineer working in Nairobi. I found my way into software in university while studying Computer Science and Informatics, partly because I felt like that was the only viable career path for me at the time. I probably would have ended up a Psychologist or a philosopher otherwise.

I am interested in Behavioral Economics, Classical Philosophy and I watch tones of Japanese Anime and casually play a couple of games like Path of Exile and League of Legends. I will probably pick up a musical instrument sooner or later..
